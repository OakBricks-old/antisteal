# An informative about linux.

Linux is not supported as data is not stored in xattr about where a file originates from, unlike MacOS and Window's ADS

Sadly, there is no solution to this problem. However, it will be rare for (correct me if I am wrong) a linux user to be stupid enough to download from a scam/reposting site.

Thanks for understanding.
